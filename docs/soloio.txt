To work with Soloii for 88d2arps.

For NEXRAD radar file with NCDC file header.

  1. Run "xltrsii" to convert the file to DORADE sweep files.
  2. Copy those sweep files (for one radar within one scan volume) into 
     the 88d2arps working directory.
  3. Create a new text file, for example "abc.txt", which contains the file
     names of those sweeps (one line per file). For example,
    
       SOLO
       swp.1070819000216.KICT.625.0.5_SUR_v2
       swp.1070819000234.KICT.131.0.5_SUR_v3
       swp.1070819000246.KICT.791.0.5_SUR_v4
       ...

     Note that the first line must be "SOLO" to denote that it contains
     file generated by converter "xltrsii".

     Furthermore, in each sweep file, the first 3 fields must be (order is important):

        0 - reflectivity (DBZ)
        1 - radial velocity (VEL)
        2 - spectrum width (SPW)

  4. Compile ARPS program "solo2arps".
  5. Run the program as usual for "88d2arps", but the argument for 
     option "-diskf" should be the text file generated above (abc.txt) now.

For raw NEXRAD radar file:

  1. Run "88d2arps" as usual with new option "-solo" or "-soloqc" or set 
     run-time configuration in the namelist file "wtsoloopt";
  2. You will get two sets of sweep files, one set is for reflectivity and 
     another set is for radial velocity and spectrum width.

     Theset two sets of files will be written in separate direction as
     "RADASOLO[QC]/[DBZ|VEl]/swp.YYYMMDDhhmmss.RADA.10.0.4_PPI_v10_[ref|vel]";

  3. Run "soloii" with each set.
  4. Edit a text file as following:

     88D2ARPS
     RADASOLO[QC]/DBZ/swp.1061109215900.KDVN.0.0.5_PPI_v1_dbz  null
     null                                                      RADASOLO[QC]/VEl/swp.1061109215918.KDVN.0.0.5_PPI_v2_vel
     ...
     RADASOLO[QC]/DBZ/swp.1061109220037.KDVN.0.1.7_PPI_v7_dbz  RADASOLO[QC]/VEl/swp.1061109220037.KDVN.0.1.7_PPI_v7_vel

     NOTE:

       (a) the first line must be "88D2ARPS" to denote that it is sweep files
           generated by "88d2arps".
       (b) each line contains two file names for the same tilt number. The first
           one is for reflectivty (ending with "_dbz"), and the second one is
           for radial velocity (ending with "_vel"). If either reflectivity or
           the radial velocity is not available for any tilt number, replace it
           with string "null".

  5. Compile and Run "solo2arps" the same way as for 88d2arps.
