 ARPS Program radmosaic

   PURPOSE: Create a mosaic of radar reflectivity from the remapped radar 
            file in the same manner as is done for the cloud analysis.  
            The mosaic file can be displayed in arpsplt using the "arbvar" 
            option.  Plots can be used for verification figures or 
            comparison to analysis output.  This program is NOT required 
            for ADAS.  ADAS does the same mosaicking within the cloud 
            analysis.

   USE:     radmosaic has its own input file, ./input/radmosaic.input 
            which consists primarily of a list of radar files to include 
            in the mosaic.  See documentation in radmosaic.input

 ARPS Program arps2rad

   PURPOSE: Using an ARPS history dump as input create a remapped radar 
            file of data to simulate the atmosphere in the history file 
            being observed by a radar.

   USE:     arps2rad has its own input file, ./input/arps2rad.input 
            which includes the history file to read and the location of 
            the observing radar.

 ARPS Program difobs

   PURPOSE: Calculates the difference between a set of observations and 
            the gridded fields in an ARPS history file.   Statistics of 
            bias and rms are reported, broken down by data source.  This 
            program allows calculation of verification statistics without 
            running the entire arpsverif code.

   USE:     difobs uses the arps.input file set up as if the data were to 
            be used in adas.  That is, the data files are named in the 
            input file and the "iuse" switches for passes 1-to-npass are 
            used to determine which data sources contribute to the global
            statistics.  Output is written to a file in the present 
            working directory with name runname.difobs.  If a file with 
            that name already exists, a sequential number is appended
            to the name.
