 
This directory contains source code for ARPSTINTRP. The program interpolates 
two ARPS history data of different times on grid of the same size to a time 
inbetween them. The output will be written into a new history dump file.

Doing 'makearps arpstintrp' in arps root directory compiles and links this package.
