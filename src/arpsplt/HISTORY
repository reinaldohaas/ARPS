This is a graphic analysis/plotting program for display ARPS
history format data set.
 
It is based on Ming Xue's graphics package ZXPLOT, which is an
independent package from the ARPS code. The object code library
of ZXPLOT for most platforms are freely available from
ftp://ftp.caps.ou.edu/pub/ZXPLOT3. Documentation and other info
on ZXPLOT can be found at http://www.caps.ou.edu/ZXPLOT.
 
ZXPLOT can be interfaced with NCAR graphics to produce metafile
output consistent with NCAR graphics viewing facilities
or linked to the Postscript driver (pure fortran program) to
produce Postscript output directly (i.e., no NCAR graphics needed).
 
Documentation on the control parameters for plotting can be found
in input/arpsplt.input.


 
AUTHOR: Ming Xue, CAPS/OU. 
  2/19/1992.     
 
MODIFICATION HISTORY:
4/1/92 version 2.1.
  wind vector plotting calls added.
 
4/7/92
  3-D wireframe plotting of w, qc+qr fields added 
  (borrow NCARgraphic routines).
 
4/13/92, version 2.2
  Modifed to handle multi-dataset.
 
4/14/92 Version 2.3.
  plt3d and plt2d names changed to ctr3d and ctr2d.
  Physical space and mapping definitions changed in ctr2d and vtr2d. 
  Plotting of a portion of domain now possible. 
  Function for overlaying of fields added.
 
  Control over the contour interval via subroutine ctrinc added.
  Control over the wind vector unit via subroutine vtrunt added.
  The aspect ratio of the 2-d plots can now be modified.
 
5/05/92 (M. Xue) and 06/04/92 (K. Brewster)
  Added full documentation.
 
6/20/92 K. Brewster
  Cosmetic changes to the output.
 
  Added runname variable to ascread.
 
6/29/92 M. Xue
  Removed external statement for getpte (caused problem on CRAY).
  Removed close(unit=...) statement before open(unit...), several
  places (caused trouble on CRAY).
 
  Vertical aspect ratio increased to 2.0
 
  Added a parameter that controls the plotting layout, this change
  affects the input file.
 
7/01/92 M. Xue
  Plot comments on the wireframe plots.
 
8/02/92 Keith Brewster
  Changed reading sequence to allow for a separate file containing
  the grid and base state information.
 
  Changed structure so that the files are not re-read for each loop
  over slicopt (DO 130).
 
  Removed start and end time parameters.  It is assumed that each file
  contains data from a single time.  Times desired are controlled by
  naming the files to plot (the end of the input file).
 
  These changes affect the input file.
 
8/09/92 M. Xue
  uprt , vprt , wprt , ptprt and qvprt  are read in from the data
  instead of u, v, w, pt and qv.

8/16/92 M. Xue
  Grouped data read into subroutine dtaread.

9/04/92 M. Xue
  Reading of parameters grdin, basin, mstin and icein from parameter
  input file was removed.  
  They are now read in directly from the data set.  

9/20/92 M. Xue
  parameter kmplot added to the input parameter reading list and 
  subroutine call to plot km added.

Version 2.6.

10/6/1992 M. Xue
  Added the option to plot slices through the w-maximum.      

10/7/1992 M. Xue
  Plotting of vertical vorticity perturbation and horizontal 
  divergence added. The input file is modified. 

10/24/1992 M. Xue
  Modified to plot multiple cross-sections (input parameters
  are affected..

12/15/1992 M. Xue
  Modified the time format in the plot caption.

12/25/1992 M. Xue and H. Jin
  Added capability to plot arbitrary cross-sections and windowed

  plotting is only available with the NCAR graphic version.  

2/09/1993 K. Brewster
  Added option to subtract a constant velocity from the mean winds
  (see imove).  User now selects whether (inwfrm = 1) or not
  (inwfrm = 0) to have a form feed separating plots from different
  times. These both affect the input file.

2/10/93 (K. Droegemeier)
