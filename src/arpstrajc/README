README file for program ARPSTRAJC and ARPSCALCTRAJC

1) Purpose: Calculates trajectories from a set of ARPS history dumps and performs 
   calculations of various quantities along those trajectories.

2) Compiling:  Type the command "makearps arpstrajc" in the ARPS root directory.  
   This will compile both the arpstrajc and arpscalctrajc executables.

3) Running:  The program is run with a namelist input file similar to the other 
   programs in the ARPS package.  Examples of arpstrajc.input and arpscalctrajc.input
   can be found in the directory ARPSROOT/input.

ATTENTIONS:

1. Right now the vorticity components along the trajectories are calculated 
   assuming the model surfaces are level.  The error should only be large 
   near steep terrain.

2. The arpsplt code was modified to allow plotting of trajectories projected
   to horizontal or vertical cross sections (not arbitrary cross sections 
   yet though).  The trajectories can be colored and an option to plot the 
   height of each trajectory at regular intervals is also provided.
