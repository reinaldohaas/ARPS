This directory contains source codes for program "ZMOSAIC2ARPS".

PURPOSE: Generate reflectivity files in ARPS grid from 
         NSSL mosaic reflectivity.  

NAMELIST: Namelist template is file "input/Zmosaic2arps.input".

STEPS:

  1. Compile the program. 
     For example, "makearps Zmosaic2arps".

  2. Edit the namelist file based on the template "input/Zmosaic2arps.input". 
     There are instructions commented for each variable in the template.

  3. Run the program. 
     For example, "bin/Zmosaic2arps < Zmosaic2arps.input >& output".

  4. The program will generate 
     o A radar column file (similar as output from 88d2arps or ncrad2arps) in binary format. 
     o File for the 2D composite reflectivity, or
     o File for hourly accumulated precipitation (in binary, HDF 4 or netCDF format).

  5. You can plot those 2D files with ARPSPLT using option for 
     plotting arbitrary variables (arbvaropt > 10). You need to set 
     arbvaropt > 10 so that it will read only one set of history files 
     (grid and base file, and one time-dependent history file). 
     Otherwise, It requires for ARPS history at all mosaic time levels.

  6. The 3D radar column file can be plotted using program "pltradcol", 
     but please use that program from earlier ARPS package (see note below).

NOTE:

  The radar column file only support binary format. Furthermore, it is 
  still in the old 88d2arps format (earlier version than arps5.2.8).
