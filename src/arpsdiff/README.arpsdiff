 
This directory contains source code for ARPSDIFF, a program that reads
in 2 sets of ARPS history format files (can have different resolution and/or 
size) and write out the difference fields also in ARPS history format. 
Interpolation will be done when the two grid configurations differ.
 
Doing 'makearps arpsdiff' in arps root directory compiles and links this package.
