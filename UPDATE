This file contains the updates in arps version 4.5.1 since arps version 4.4.0. 
For more details on these changes, see file HISTORY.

Version 4.5.1

- Corrected a bug which reversed the order of soil levels in GRIB data
  in ext2arps.
- Changed input file reading for message passing version of the ARPS.
- Integrated Hub-CAPS modifications into the official version.
- Corrected MDCRS data processing in ADAS.
- Updated ensemble code.
- Added arpsassim (thermodynamic retrieval) package.
- Added Ruc2 native and isobaric GRIB files to ext2arps.
- Corrected error in ADAS which caused cloud observations to be rejected.
- Fixed problem with century change over in reading GRIB files in ext2arps.
- Changed snow cover (0 or 1) to be snow depth in meters.
- Corrected an error in soil model which reduced the interaction between deep
  and surface soil by half.
- Corrected RUC specific humidity conversions in ext2arps.
  
Version 4.5.0

- Added a new subroutine to support NCEP AVN data conversion in EXT2ARPS. 
- Fixed a bug with the Kain-Fritsch scheme calls.
- Synchronized quality control flags for u and v components of winds.
- Removed version numbers from filenames of each program
- Added new terrain pre-processing program arpstrn (different from arpstern)
- Added new program ARPSTINTRP for interpolating two ARPS history data
  sets to another time
- Added several new parameters for fine-tuning the plots in arpsplt.input.
- Changed the coefficient in the dissipation term of TKE equation
  for the lowest two levels Sun and Chang scheme (tkeopt=3).
- TKE at the same time level as the dissipation term in the TKE
  equation is now used to determine Km.
- Change made to ext2arps for ETA #212 to use sfc temp. as tsfc instead
  of the first layer soil temp.
- Updated the calculation of solar time equation with more accurate
  formula
- Fixed a bug in two-way nest computation of pressure in small steps
- Fixed a problem in the calculation of surface radiation fluxes for
  the diffusive radiation
- Fixed a bug in ext2arps in writing wetcanp into soil variable file
- New control parameters for iterative soil model initialization of balance
- Added snow cover in a simple scheme for soil model
- Changed the format of soil variable file to include the soil variables
  associated with multiple soil types at each grid points
- Fixed an error in soil model in calculating wr2max for the one-step
  prediction
- Added Incremental Analysis Uupdate (a way of nudging) scheme in ARPS
- Changed the use of pibar to full pi
- Significantly improved code efficiency by removing operators,
  combining loops and storing repeatedly used values. 
- Fixed a bug in initialization with option sfcdat=1
- Added new subroutines to write GrADS control file for surface, soil,
  and terrain data files for GrADS display
- Fixed a few problems in GrADS control files for GRIB and GrADS formats
- Fixed a problem in computing the drag coefficients in sfcphy3d.f
  when multiple soil types are defined in a grid box.
- Changed default compiler option for arpsplt on SGI so as not to use IPA option
- Upgraded ADAS to include writing analysis increments for the ARPS 
  nudging (incremental analysis update) scheme
- Bug fixes in cmpclddrv.f and cldinsert.f to properly account for
  the limited areal coverage of the physical domain within the
  ARPS grid
- Bug fix in RADMCRO after DO 150 to go to next column
- Bug fix in prepsfc.f and rdsfcobs.f to correct a problem with
  cloud height storage indexing when using multiple input sfc
  observation files
- Fixed a problem in ext2arps when the external GRIB data are in random
  order in vertical.
- Fixed a problem in src/arps_mp/Makefile to include an ARPS new file in
  the src and obj list
- Fixed problems in Vis5D history dump
- Modifications in the cloud code and call to cmpclddrv to clean up a
  few problems due to switch to ARPS grid in cloud code
